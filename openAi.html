     <h1>OpenAi</h1>

     <p>
     
        OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever and others. Its aim is to promote and develop "general" artificial intelligence that benefits humanity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Part of the OpenAI model is a positive initiative in favour of transparency. Currently funded to the tune of $1 billion, the company is committed to making its research and patents public. It also maintains an open invitation to like-minded individuals to apply for a role within this collaborative enterprise.
    However, another major part of OpenAI's philosophy is both preventive and reactionary. Reports show that Elon Musk has described artificial intelligence as one of the major threats to the future of humanity. Many people in related industries share this concern about a potential 'intelligence explosion' that could render human intelligence obsolete or have other negative and unintended consequences for humanity. With this in mind, part of OpenAI's work is to explore how to take safe and deliberate steps in AI, rather than leaving its future to the whims of the free market.
    <br>
    <br>
    OpenAI has thus become the company behind the biggest industrial successes in the artificial intelligence sector, but not without some controversy. In 2019, the not-for-profit organisation became a "capped for-profit" company in response to significant financial needs. Under this new status, the company undertakes to limit its earnings to a ceiling set at 100 times the amount of an investment.
